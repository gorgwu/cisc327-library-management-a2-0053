Test cases are in 'tests' folder, named R1_test.py to R7_test.py.
The command I used to run the test cases is at the top of each file as a comment (it was mainly for my own sake).

Note that the test cases (for the functions that have been implemented, so not R4-R7) use/edit the actual database from library.db, so tests may be inconsistent based on what is in the database.

Test cases should cover most (if not all) the requirements from requirements_specifications.md.

R1 tests adding a book to the catalog, R3 tests book borrowing, R4 tests book returning, R5 tests the late fee, R6 tests book searching, and R7 tests getting a patron report.

I was a bit unsure of how to test R2 given that there was no function for it in library_service.py.
So, I assume I'm testing adding and retrieving all books, not the HTTP requests.
(In other words, I'm testing the helper get_all_books() and not catalog() which strictly uses get_all_books() in an HTTP request).

Lastly, my database may look a bit odd (book IDs 1-6 and then it skips to 10) since I used a VScode extension to delete entries when writing my test cases.
